## NCSSAR application launcher for Windows desktop, to increase consistency, reliability, and user-friendliness

There is often confusion about 'which icon should I click' to run sartopo, or to run radiolog, or to start IAP-builder - especially when there are different users who may or may not have recent experience with the software tool in question.

We want this launcher to be prominent, but we do NOT want to take over the entire Windows desktop.  The user could choose to close or minimize the launcher, and they would still see all the necessary desktop icons as normal.  The launcher should not interfere with the Windows taskbar.

Icons to include:
- most commonly used:
  - sartopo (desktop-server vs desktop-localhost vs web - not all three exist for every computer)  Would this look like a group box of two or three icons?
  - radiolog
  - IAP-builder
- less commonly used
  - plans console
  - offline address search
  - others?
